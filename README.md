## Overview of Project:

We are given a dataset which contains images of Dogs and Cats . Our aim is to develop an algorithm  which will take an input image and based on parameters the algorithm has learned , it will predict whether the given input test image is a cat or dog

## Data Description:   
For this project , I will be using the data from a Kaggle Competition named <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats'>Dogs v. Cats</a>.<br>

For this section we'll be working with a version of the Cats vs. Dogs dataset inspired by a classic <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats'>Kaggle competition</a>.<br>

We have organized the files into train and test folders, and further divided the images into CAT and DOG subfolders. In this way the file path contains the label.
