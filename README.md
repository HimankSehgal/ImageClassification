## Overview of Project:

We are given a dataset which contains images of Dogs and Cats . Our aim is to develop an algorithm  which will take an input image and based on parameters the algorithm has learned , it will predict whether the given input test image is a cat or dog

## Data Description: 
* Historical stock prices(SENSEX (S&P BSE SENSEX)) from https://finance.yahoo.com/

* Textual (News) data from https://bit.ly/36fFPI6
